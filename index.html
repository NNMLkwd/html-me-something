    <h1>Thinking of Raising Ducks? Reconsider.</h1>
</header>
</body>
<p>Growing up in southwest Denver, I was taught to produce as much food as possible from the backyard. A common chore after school was weeding and preparing dinner. In the Fall, we canned food raised in the garden.</p>
<p>Our main heat source was locally-collected firewood.</p>
<p>I remember thinking as a kid that I would never do such labor intensive work as canning and builing a firewood stash when I grew up.</p>
<p>It's funny how many times we turn out like our parents.</p>
<p>Now, I finish off summer by spending hours working through the canning process and documenting all my findings like just how many pounds of tomatoes does it take to make a quart of paste? How many times can I reuse a canning lid?</p>
<p>Firewood is just as bad. If I don't have 3 cords curing, I didn't do my job.</p>
<p>Several years ago, I decided to take it a step further.</p>
<p>I decided that I would raise chickens. What could be better than fresh eggs anytime I wanted and the bonus would be the chicken poop thrilling the red wigglers in my compost bins.</p>
<p>One skill I've never had the patience (or the motivation to spend lots of money) for is carpentry. My Mom loves to get my Dad out of the house so I'm sure there was an offer to help me build a coop but I likely declined thinking it will be better if I figured it out myself.</p>
<p>It's not uncommon for those who want to get into the chicken business to buy some chicks and think they have all the time in the world to get the coop built. </p>
<p>So I started scouring Craigslist for someone selling chicks.</p>
<p>The chicks took up residence in a big plastic container in the bathroom.</p>
<p>One thing you notice really fast about chicks is they drink water like there is no tomorrow. Their eating routine was like a food-fight with crumbles flying everywhere.</p>
<p>This combination leads to having to clean the container every single day because these little creatures poop up a storm. </p>
<p>Like the fastest weed in your yard, pretty soon they were able to jump out out of the container.</p>
<p>The noise was also getting incredible. I'd be talking on the phone with this horrible chirping in the background.</p>
<p>That's where it started to get expensive. I vaguely remember the goal was fresh eggs.</p>
<p>Not being a carpenter - I just like owning the tools - I bought a coop for $200. </p>
<p>Then there was the feeders.</p>
