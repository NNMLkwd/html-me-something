<div class="canning">Growing up in southwest Denver, I was taught to produce as much food as possible from the backyard.
    <br>
    <br>
    We planted excess so we could can food for Winter.
    <br>
    <br>I remember thinking as a kid that I would never do such labor intensive work as canning or building a firewood stash when I grew up.
    <br>
    It's funny how many times we turn out like our parents.
    <br>
    Now, instead of just trotting down to the store and grabbing a jar of "mystery-processed" spaghetti sauce, I finish off summer by spending hours working through the canning process and documenting my findings.

    <div id=floated"><strong>Firewood is the same story.</strong>
        <br>
        Remembering all the work and sweat in cutting, splitting, and stacking wood as a kid, I thought I would never want to do it again.
        <br>
        Now as an adult, I feel uneasy if I don't have 2-3 cords curing. I spent as much on a wood splitter as I did my daily driver car, which was less than $800 so I guess that's not too horrible. It's still a considerable amount of money. It is delightful to take breaks from the computer and stand next to the fire. My dog loves it and hogs the spot in front of the woodstove.</div>

    <reg_font>In 2013, I decided to take it a step further with my homesteading skills.
        <br>
        <br>
        I decided that I would raise chickens!
        <br>
        <br>
        Fresh eggs anytime.
        <br>
        <br>
        Bonus organic chicken poop and coop straw to thrill the red wigglers in my compost bins.</reg_font>

    <p>After spending hours researching the best chicken breeds, I started scouring Craigslist for someone selling chicks.
        <br>
        <br>
         One of the items to keep in mind when buying chicks is that unless you buy sexed chicks which are called "Sexlink", you take the risk of getting a rooster.
         <br>
         <br>
         There is a way to sex chickens by hand but it's a skill and I'll leave it up to you to watch this video if you want a bit more information. The computer voice is strange but the advantage is I'm helping share a job opening for those who might need it.

    <br>
    
    
    <p>The new fluffy chicks took up residence in a big plastic container in the bathroom.
    You notice really fast that chicks drink water like there is no tomorrow. Their eating routine was like a food-fight with feed pellets flying everywhere. This combination leads to having to clean the container every single day because these little creatures poop up a storm. Like the fastest weed in your yard, pretty soon they were able to jump out out of the container.</p>
    
    <p>The noise was also reaching annoying levels. I'd be talking on the phone with this horrible chirping in the background. The party on the other end of the phone would ask where the hell that noise was coming from.
    
    It was finally spring and warm enough that the chicks could go out and live in the backyard.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>That's where it started to get expensive. I vaguely remember the goal was fresh eggs. I'm not a good carpenter (I just like owning the tools) so I bought a coop for $200.
        <br>
        <br>
        Then I bought a used shed for $100 because I needed to store hay.
        <br>
        <br>
        Then the feeders, water heater, security fencing, and regular visits to the feed store because chickens do not eat daintily and waste a lot of food they toss around. Mice got a hell of a deal out of this homesteading experiment.
        <br>
        <br>
                Still no food because a chicken doesn't start to lay eggs until they are a few months old. I waited patiently, dreaming of the gorgeous eggs that I would soon have. The time finally came.</p>
    <p>I was <i>now</i> one of <i>those</i> chicken people.

        I got into the "chicken-thing" so much that I ran Homesteading Classes at the Arvada Harvest Festival. This included setting up a Chicken Scramble contest which consisted of people entering their chickens to race against each other.
        <br>
        This took a lot of work.
        <br>
        I found sponsors who donated prizes. We needed two-dozen volunteers plus the sustainability-specific tables to give classes on everything from milking goats to mastering compost to beekeeping.

        KYGO was the Chicken Scramble emcee and the event was the biggest hit of the festival.

        We even had a chicken costume contest, sadly I can't locate that photo but a lady had spent hours making both a Lucy and Ethel costume for two hens based upon the I Love Lucy episode from the chocolate factory.
        <br>
        Quite hilarious. I really wish I had that photo to share with you.

        (Note: Somewhere prior to this point, I should have seriously considered the fact that I only eat eggs about twice a month.)</p></article>

<div class="raccoons"> 
    <p>While the chickens were finally producing eggs; the neighborhood predators started to drool over potential free dinner for themselves. 
            <p>A family of raccoons had setup shop in my neighbor's back yard. Each evening they would sit on the roof or in the tree patiently waiting for their time.</p>

    <br>
    To this day, my 100-pound pitbull and mastiff mix only knows of one undisputable enemy - the raccoons. Every other creature is his friend.
<br>
<br>
He takes his job of protecting against raccoons pretty seriously.

<p>I made lots of mistakes in the chicken adventure. #1 was neglecting to consider that I only eat eggs occassionally. My Mom and Dad were super excited about the eggs but they also didn't have to do any of the maintenance, deal with freezing water, extra mice, chicken manure everywhere possible, or the other "fun".
    <br>
    I had started to let the birds free-range during the day because the grass sure wasn't surviving in their pen.
    <br>
    <strong>Over the course of several months, every one of the chickens became dinner for one of the local predators.</strong>
    <br>
All it took was being a few minutes late getting home from work and not beating dusk.
<br>
<br>
With all the hens now gone, I took a Winter break. Swearing that I had enough with coming home to a ripped apart chicken that I had hand-raised.
<br>
I wasn't even one of those crazy-chicken people who name the birds. I just called them collectively "Here birdies!" and usually I was carrying their food so I didn't need to use any other calling note.
<br>
Winter came and then Spring...I began to forget the challenges and got jealous that other people had fresh eggs and all I had was those crummy eggs from the store. Did I mention that I actually only eat eggs a couple times a month?
<br>
<br>
<p><strong>So I decided to change it up and get ducks.</P></strong>
<img src="http://nataliementen.com/images/Duckies-Golden-White-3weeks-framed.jpg" alt="Fuzzy Ducks">
    
<p>I had read that ducks had so many bonuses compared to chickens they would be dandy choice!</p>

<ul>
    <li>Ducks give you eggs twice as long as chickens.</li>
    <li>Ducks are much more winter-hardy.</li>
    <li>If you get a male, he won't have a rally call at dawn.</li>
    <li>Duck eggs are richer in nutrients.</li>

</ul>
<div class="raccoons">
    <strong>The Reality of Chickens vs Ducks</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    The ducks had a lot of advantages but many disadvantages. If I thought chicken drank a lot of water and pooped up a storm - ducks did that 5X as much. Unlike chickens which daintly drink out of a chicken waterer, ducks need buckets of water because they wash their nostrils by dunking their heads. During the summer months I kept a kiddy pool so they could have some fun but that meant I had to wash the pool every week because of all their <strong>crapping</strong> in the water.
    <br>
    <br>
    Fresh beautifully cleaned pool and 12 hours later it had been pooped in 143 times.
    <br>
    <br>
    Chicken vs Duck NOISE - After the chickens had grown up, their chirping turned into gentle clucking which was actually soothing. Only when they laid their eggs did they make some noticeable noise.
    <br>
    <strong>Duck noise? Holy hell.</strong> Forget taking an afternoon nap. Quack! Quack! Quack! All freaking day long.
    <br>
    <br>
    Now to the animal sex issue. Little did I know that male ducks have a sex drive that rivals all.
    Male ducks don't use foreplay. No ruffling feathers with a coy look. Instead, they viciously grab the female by her head or neck, straddle her down and 14 seconds (or less) it's over but that depends on how stable he was able to mount her. 
    <br>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e2ngF_uXNNE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <br>
    <br>
    The pool of water really triggered this male action. During the months of freezing night weather it was difficult to keep the kiddie pool going so the substitute was a couple 2 &#189; gallon buckets always filled with clean water so they could dip their heads into the water.
    One of the females couldn't resist trying to swim and thought it was cool to jump into the bucket of water. It was a tight fit.
    <br>
    <br>
    One day I came home from work to find her drowned in the bucket. I noticed fresh mating marks on her head and neck. The male looked at me weird but he did that regularly. I think he jumped her in the bucket and killed her while mating.
    <br>
    <br>
    After that, I sold the remaining ducks to a local family who owned several acres and other ducks.
    <br>
    <br>
    It took more than 6 months before I stopped hearing that horrible quacking in my head. Did I mention that I only eat eggs about twice a month?</div>
