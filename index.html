<div class="canning"><p>Growing up in southwest Denver, I was taught to produce as much food as possible from the backyard.
    <br>
    <br>
    We planned on excess so we could can food for Winter.
    <br>
    <br>I remember thinking as a kid that I would never do such labor intensive work as canning or building a firewood stash when I grew up.</p>
        
        <p>It's funny how many times we turn out like our parents.</p>
        
        <p>Now, I finish off summer by spending hours working through the canning process and documenting my findings.</p>

        <p>How many pounds of tomatoes does it take to make a quart of paste?

        <br>
        <br>
        Remembering all the work and sweat in cutting, splitting, and stacking wood - I thought I would never want to do it again. Now as an adult, if I don't have 3 cords curing then I didn't do my job. I spent as much on a wood splitter as I did my daily driver car, which was less than $800 so I guess that's not too horrible.</p></div>

    <p>In 2013, I decided to take it a step further with my homesteading skills. I decided that I would raise chickens. What could be better than fresh eggs anytime I wanted and the bonus would be the chicken poop thrilling the red wigglers in my compost bins.
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>I wouldn't contribute to the chicken farms where the hen never gets to leave the cage.</p>

    <p>After spending hours researching the best chicken breeds, I started scouring Craigslist for someone selling chicks. One of the items to keep in mind when buying chicks is that unless you buy sexed chicks which are called "Sexlink", you take the risk of getting a rooster but I remember thinking that I'd get lucky or just deal with it when the time came. There is a way to sex chickens by hand but it's a skill and I'll leave it you to watch this <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApFqMLWJSqs"></iframe> Humans are lucky that it's quite obvious at birth.</p>
    
    
    <p>The new fluffy chicks took up residence in a big plastic container in the bathroom.
    You notice really fast that chicks drink water like there is no tomorrow. Their eating routine was like a food-fight with feed pellets flying everywhere. This combination leads to having to clean the container every single day because these little creatures poop up a storm. Like the fastest weed in your yard, pretty soon they were able to jump out out of the container.</p>
    
    <p>The noise was also reaching annoying levels. I'd be talking on the phone with this horrible chirping in the background. The party on the other end of the phone would ask where the hell that noise was coming from.
    
    It was finally spring and warm enough that the chicks could go out and live in the backyard.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>That's where it started to get expensive. I vaguely remember the goal was fresh eggs. I'm not a good carpenter (I just like owning the tools) so I bought a coop for $200. The cost then escalated due to the feeders, water heater, security fencing, and regular visits to the feed store because chickens do not eat daintily and waste a lot of food they toss around. Mice got a hell of a deal out of this homesteading experiment. Still no food because a chicken doesn't start to lay eggs until they are a few months old. I waited patiently, dreaming of the gorgeous eggs that I would soon have. The time finally came.</p>
    <p>I was now one of <i>those</i> chicken people. Bragging when the first egg popped out. Posting on Facebook when I ran into a double-yolker.</p></article>

<div class="raccoons"> 
    <p>While the chickens were giving me food; the neighborhood predators started to drool over potential free dinner for themselves. 
            <p>A family of raccoons had setup shop in my neighbor's back yard. Each evening they would sit on the roof or in the tree patiently waiting for their time.</p>

    <br>

    <br>
    To this day, my 100-pound pitbull and mastiff mix only knows of one undisputable enemy - the raccoons. Every other creature is his friend.</p></div> 
   
<p>I made mistakes. I had started to let the birds free-range during the day because the grass sure wasn't surviving in their pen. <strong>Over the course of several months, every one of the chickens became dinner for one of the local predators.</strong>
All it took was being a few minutes late getting home from work and not beating dusk.

I took a break that winter. Swearing that I had enough with coming home to a ripped apart chicken that I had lovingly raised. I wasn't even one of those crazy-chicken people who names the birds. I just called them collectively and usually that was when I was carrying their food so I didn't need to use any other calling note.

Winter came and then Spring...I began to forget the challenges and got jealous that other people had fresh eggs and all I had was those crummy eggs from the store.
<br>
<br>
<p><strong>So I decided to change it up and get ducks.</P></strong>

<p>I had read that ducks had so many bonuses compared to chickens they would be dandy choice!</p>

<ul>
    <li>Ducks give you eggs twice as long as chickens.</li>
    <li>Ducks are much more winter-hardy.</li>
    <li>If you get a male, he won't have a rally call at dawn.</li>
    <li>Duck eggs are richer in nutrients.</li>

</ul>
