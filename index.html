    <h1>Thinking of Raising Ducks? Reconsider!</h1>
</header>

<section><p>Growing up in southwest Denver, I was taught to produce as much food as possible from the backyard. We canned food raised in the garden.

        I remember thinking as a kid that I would never do such labor intensive work as canning and building a firewood stash when I grew up.</p>
        
        <p>It's funny how many times we turn out like our parents.</p>
        
        <p>Now, I finish off summer by spending hours working through the canning process and documenting all my findings. <img src="http://nataliementen.com/images/nm_site/tomatoes-kitchenaid.jpg" alt="Romas for Paste" style="width:175px;height:311px;">  How many pounds of tomatoes does it take to make a quart of paste? You can find my results <a href="http://nataliementen.com/index.php/we-will">right here.</a></p>
        
        <p>Firewood is just as bad. Remembering all the work in cutting, splitting, and stacking wood - I thought I would never want to do it again. Now, if I don't have 3 cords curing, I didn't do my job. I spent as much on a wood splitter as I did my daily driver car, which was less than $800 so I guess that's not too horrible.</p></section>

<article><p>Several years ago, I decided to take it a step further with my homesteading skills. I decided that I would raise chickens. What could be better than fresh eggs anytime I wanted and the bonus would be the chicken poop thrilling the red wigglers in my compost bins. I wouldn't contribute to the abusive chicken farms where the hen never gets to leave the cage. It's not uncommon for those who want to get into the chicken business to buy some chicks and think they have all the time in the world to get the coop built. </p>

    <p>After spending hours researching the best chicken breeds, I started scouring Craigslist for someone selling chicks. One of the items to keep in mind when buying chicks is that unless you buy sexed chicks which is called "Sexlink". You take the risk of getting a rooster but I remember thinking that I'd get lucky or just deal with it when the time came.</p>
    
    
    <p>The chicks took up residence in a big plastic container in the bathroom.
    You notice really fast that chicks drink water like there is no tomorrow. Their eating routine was like a food-fight with feed pellets flying everywhere. This combination leads to having to clean the container every single day because these little creatures poop up a storm. Like the fastest weed in your yard, pretty soon they were able to jump out out of the container.</p>
    
    <p>The noise was also reaching annoying levels. I'd be talking on the phone with this horrible chirping in the background. The party on the other end of the phone would ask where the hell that noise was coming from.
    
    It was finally spring and warm enough that the chicks could go out and live in the backyard.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>That's where it started to get expensive. I vaguely remember the goal was fresh eggs. I'm not a good carpenter (I just like owning the tools) so I bought a coop for $200. The cost then escalated due to the feeders, water heater, security fencing, and regular visits to the feed store because chickens do not eat daintily and waste a lot of food they toss around. Mice got a hell of a deal out of this homesteading experiment. Still no food because a chicken doesn't start to lay eggs until they are a few months old. I waited patiently, dreaming of the gorgeous eggs that I would soon have. The time finally came.</p>
    <p>I was now one of <i>those</i> chicken people. Bragging when the first egg popped out. Posting on Facebook when I ran into a double-yolker.</p></article>
    <p>While the chickens were giving me food; the raccoons, coyotes, and hawks in the neighborhood were figuring out that I was raising food for them.
            <div class="raccoon"> <p>A family of raccoons had setup shop inn my neighbor's back yard. Each evening they would sit on the roof or in the tree patiently waiting for their time.</p>

    <br>

    <br>
    To this day, my 100-pound pitbull and mastiff mix has only been taught of one enemy, the raccoons. Every other creature is his friend.</p></div> 
   
<p>I got sloppy. I had started to let the birds free-range during the day because the grass sure wasn't surving in their pen. Over the course of several months, every one of the chickens became dinner for one of the local predators.</p>
<p>All it took was being a few minutes late getting home from work and not beating dusk.</p>
<p>I took a break that winter. Swearing that I had enough with coming home to a ripped apart chicken that I had lovingly raised. I wasn't even one of those crazy-chicken people who names the birds. I just called them collectively and usually that was when I was carrying their food so I didn't need to use any other calling note.</p>

<p>Winter came and then Spring...I began to forget the challenges and get jealous that other people had fresh eggs and all I had was those crummy eggs from the store.  So I decided to change it up and get ducks.</P>

<p>I had read that ducks had so many bonuses compared to chickens they would be dandy.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Ducks give you eggs twice as long as chickens.</li>
    <li>Ducks are much more winter-hardy.</li>
    <li>If you get a male, he won't have a rally call at dawn.</li>
    <li>Duck eggs are richer in nutrients.</li>

</ul>
